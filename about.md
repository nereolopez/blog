Hey, thanks for stopping by! My name is Nereo López and I am from Vigo, in Spain. I just arrived to the 30s, I am happily married with a passionate Designer, and have no children yet.

Professionally, I started my career as a Software Developer, and I’ve been through different companies and very different domains. Later with 26, I switched to Scrum Master and Line Manager, and 2 years later I moved on into the PM side.

I like being PM in Agile environments, but can’t kill my techie side, so I stay as close to the team as possible (unluckily for them :p). Of course, I am always putting my hands on every new technology that comes out, and even started the Ionic community down in Barcelona back in 2014. Unfortunately, when I relocated to Stuttgart I had to hand it over.

Now, I am enjoying back sunny Barcelona!
