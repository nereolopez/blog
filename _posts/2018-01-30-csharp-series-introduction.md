Welcome back!

Are you looking for a C# step by step series? You came to the right place (I hope! ^^’). From time to time I become a teacher during the evening on different topics (Angular, Ionic, UWP, Automation…).  I am making this material available as an Automation course which had a first part of Introduction to Programming on C# goes on. So, at the time you read this it might still be work in progress and some links might be missing. I will complete the series, I promise!

The code for the series is hosted on [this repo](https://github.com/nereolopez/csharp-intro).
